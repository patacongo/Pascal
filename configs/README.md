# Example NuttX Configuration Files

These are variable NuttX configuration files that were used for testing.

## defconfig.sim-hostfs

### Setup:

- Retains Pascal executables in a HostFS file system that links to the pascal/papps/image directory.  The path of CONFIG_PASCAL_MOUNT_OPTIONS in the deconfig.sim-hostfs file is an absolute path and, hence, will need to be adapted for your environment.  It will need to be the path to the Pascal host clone's `papps/image` directory where you generated the Pascal executables.
- Normally you would want two separate clones, one set for the target configurate and linked at the `apps/pascal` and another cross withe a host configuration to develop the Pascal executables on the host.
- When building these Pascal executables, be careful with the file `pascal/papps/punits/Machine.pas`.  That is a special, auto-generated file that provides platform-specific settings for the Pascal code.  The version of the file used probably resides in the host clone but must reflect the properties of the target environment.  You may have to hand edit `pascal/papps/punits/Machine.pas` after is it initially created.

In `Machine.pas`:

-`ExecPath` must reflect the correct directory location in the target environment.
-`MachinePointerSize` must be the size of a target machine pointer.
- The home directory could also be an issue.

### Usage:

1. Make sure that the Pascal directory is clean

    make distclean

2. Link the Pascal directory into the apps directory

    cd <nuttx-apps-directory>
    ln -s <pascal-directory> pascal

3. Configure the NuttX directory

    cd <nuttx-directory>
    tools/configure.sh [OPTIONS] sim:nsh
    cp <pascal-directory>/configs/defconfig.sim-hostfs .config
    make olddefconfig

4. Change the CONFIG_PASCAL_MOUNT_OPTIONS path

    make menuconfig

5. And build

    make

### Comments/Status:

- I am seeing instability.  If you just run the simulator, it will fail with a segment violation.

    $ ./nuttx.exe
    Segmentation fault (core dumped)

- But if I use GDB and single step, I can see that most of the code is running fine and that the segment violation happens in `closedir()` which is passed a bad DIR pointer.
- When I run under GDB, things runs almost normally:  The Pshell prompt appears.  There is normal output to `stdout` from Pascal *WRITELN*.  Input on `stdin` is received okay with echo of the debugger character input on the console.  Note that everthying you see after "/bin/Pshell.pex Loaded" is generated by Pascal running on the target.

- I can spawn multiple instances of the Pshell:

    psh> r phello.pex
    /bin/phello.pex Loaded
    Hello, World!
    Exit with code 0
    psh> r PShell.pex
    /bin/PShell.pex Loaded
    psh> r PShell.pex
    /bin/PShell.pex Loaded
    psh> [New Thread 17352.0x3ea4]
    [New Thread 17352.0x153c]
    q
    Exit with code 0
    psh> q
    Exit with code 0
    psh> q
    Exit with code 0

- A possible issue is that I let the simulator set with no input until GDB spawns several more threads, then it hangs.  I suspect this is a simulator issue, however.

## defconfig.stm32f4discovery-sd

### Setup:

- Requires the STM32-BB baseboard for its micro SD slot (and uses USART6)
- Requires that a micro-SD card be inserted that contains Pascal executables in the root directory.  The Pshell, `Pshell.pex`, in particular, must be there.
- When building these Pascal executables for the SD card, be careful with the file `pascal/papps/punits/Machine.pas`.  That is a special, auto-generated file that provides platform-specific settings for the Pascal code.  The version of the file used probably resides in the host clone but must reflect the properties of the target environment.  You may have to hand edit `pascal/papps/punits/Machine.pas` after is it initially created.

### Usage:

1. Make sure that the Pascal directory is clean

    cd <pascal-directory>
    make distclean

2. Link the Pascal directory into the apps directory

    cd <nuttx-apps-directory>
    ln -s <pascal-directory> pascal

3. Configure the NuttX directory

    cd <nuttx-directory>
    tools/configure.sh [OPTIONS] stm32f4discovery:netnsh
    cp <pascal-directory>/configs/defconfig.stm32f4discovery-sd .config
    make olddefconfig

4. And build

    make

### Comments/Status:

- Fails with a read error of some kind while loading Pshell.pex.  The SD card and file are known good and verify (with the same read logic) on the host system.  So I am suspecting some issue with my old STM32 F4-Discovery board.

## defconfig.stm32f4discovery-romfs

### Setup:

- Requires the STM32-BB baseboard *only* because it uses USART6.  Than can be re-configured.
- When building these Pascal executablesfor the ROMFS filesystem, be careful with the file `pascal/papps/punits/Machine.pas`.  That is a special, auto-generated file that provides platform-specific settings for the Pascal code.  The version of the file used probably resides in the host clone but must reflect the properties of the target environment.  You may have to hand edit `pascal/papps/punits/Machine.pas` after is it initially created.

### Usage:

1. Run the host build in order to create compile the Pascal files and build the romfs image

    cd <pascal-directory>
    make memconfig -- configure to run natively on Linux

2. Copy the romfs image into the NuttX source tree

    cp <pascal-directory>/papps/romfs/romfs.img <nuttx-directory>/boards/arm/stm32/common/.

3. Make sure that the Pascal directory is clean

    make distclean

4. Link the Pascal directory into the apps directory

    cd <nuttx-apps-directory>
    ln -s <pascal-directory> pascal

5. Configure the NuttX directory

    cd <nuttx-directory>
    tools/configure.sh [OPTIONS] stm32f4discovery:netnsh
    cp <pascal-directory>/configs/defconfig.stm32f4discovery-romfs .config
    make olddefconfig

6. And build

    make

### Comments/Status:

- See above discusion with regard to `defconfig.sim-hostfs` above for status; the behavior of Pascal on the STM32-F4 Discovery is same as that under the simulator.
- This is a work in progress and not quite ready for prime time.
