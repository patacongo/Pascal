Pascal-0.1.0 Release Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the initial release of a small Pascal compiler.  This
is a compiler that I have worked tinkered with for many years.
It is being released now to provide an interpreted language of
the NuttX RTOS.

The state of this compiler is uncertain at this time and so
must be at a pre-alpha level.  It contains some partially
implemented features.  For this realease, only 16-bit p-code
output has been tests (and only superficially).

The compiler includes the NuttX runtime that can be used to
execute compiled Pascal P-code files from NuttX.
