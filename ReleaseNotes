pascal-0.1.2
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the 3rd release of the Pascal P-Code add-on to NuttX. This
release adds support for some additional toolchains and standardizes
the binary format to big-endian for portability of the P-Code across
different platforms.  This release is synchronized with the release
of NuttX-0.3.8.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from February 10, 2008.

pascal-0.1.3
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This was a bug-fix release

pascal-2.0
^^^^^^^^^^

This release updates all of the code to use the standard types defined
in the C99 files stdint.h and stdbool.h.  This change was necessary for
compatibility with NuttX-5.0.  No functional changes were made.

The release version was bumped to 2.0 because these changes introduce
typing incompatibilies with earlier versions.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from December 21, 2009.
