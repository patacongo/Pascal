testall.sh compiles all (most) of the pascal source files in the src/ sub-directory.  The src/ sub-directory contains various pascal programs found by scouring the internet (most not attributed here.. sorry).  As of this writing, the following errors are reported when testall.sh is ran:

 1. Several test cases fail because the involve use of non-standard Pascal types
    (filename, list, word) and undefined procedures (fsplit, addr).
    test cases using the list type probably have been removed; For testing purposes,
    the filename type has been changed to the string type.
    According to freepascal.org, fsplit is a procedure in a unit called DOS.  I am
    not sure how standard that unit is.
 2. Currently a set is limited to 32-bits to so that they can be represented internally
    as a 32-bit bit set.
 3. Input procedures in writeln() take the file number as an optional first parameter.
    If the optional file parameter is not supplied then the file associated with the
    built-in variable input is tested.  Similarly, ouoptout procedures would default to
    the built-in output.
    This has been fixed for some functions (like eof and eoln) but not all cases have been
    verified.
 4. Operations on type 'string' are not yet supported
 5. I/O operations on most types of arrays and VAR arrays are not fully
    implemented.  See rc/107-quicksort.pas
 6. Forward references to variables before the are defined to not work.  See
    src/108-pointerrecode.pas
 7. More scoping problems with local variables as seen in src/112-localscope.pas.  The
    kludge used for formal parmeters (above) cannot be used with local variables.  I think
    that we need to extend the symbol lookup so that it can look at the current local scope
    or at the the entire scope based on the current staic nesting level.  This would have
    to be a backward search from the current nesting level down.
 8. Unit files with data declarations, but no implementation.
 9. General usage of units.  Most of these are not skipped by testall.sh.

Successful test results are not shown.

########src/104-primes.pas########
Line 0:0012 Error 47 Token 3b

Line (in var section):
 12   sieve, primes : array[0..w] of set of 0..maxbit;

Where (in const section)
  8   maxbit = 58;

Error:
244 #define eSETRANGE        ((uint16_t) 0x47)

Analysis:
This is a consequence of the fact that sets are currently limited to 32-bits:

########src/107-quicksort.pas########
Line 0:0024 Error 17 Token 29'

Where a is a formal parameter of type 'VAR a: IntArrType' and where

    CONST

    TYPE
        IntArrType = ARRAY [1..MaxElts] OF Integer;

          /* Otherwise, we fall through to process the ARRAY like any */

        default :

          switch (varParm(exprUnknown, NULL))
            {
            ...
            default :

              break;
            }
          break;

This error occurs because varParm() returns expArrayPtr but there is no code generation logic in the switch statement for that case.

Fails becuase recdata is not defined yet and the forward reference is not supported.

Analysis:
Same problem as with src/108-pointerrecode.pas:  Use of forward reference to define a pointer variable fails.
